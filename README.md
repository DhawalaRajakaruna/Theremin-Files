# Theremin

## What is a Theremin?

The **Theremin** is one of the earliest electronic musical instruments, played without physical contact. It uses the proximity of the performer's hands to two antennasâ€”one controlling pitch and the other controlling volumeâ€”to generate sound.

## Our Project

We have implemented a **functional Theremin using only analog electronics**â€”no microcontrollers or digital systems were used. The design and behavior of the system were:

- âœ… Simulated using **LTspice**  
- âœ… Realized through a **custom-designed PCB** using **Altium Designer**  
- âœ… Controlled via **two antennas** that sense hand proximityâ€”one for pitch control and one for volume control
